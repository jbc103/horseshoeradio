      <h3>What is HAM Radio</h3>
      <p>Ham radio is a common nickname for the more proper term amateur radio.  It is a service often used for public service events and emergency communication, and a hobby with many sub-hobbies available to interest almost anyone.</p>
      <p>Before going futher into ham radio, let's take a minute to talk about other ways to play radio and what some of the differences are between them and ham radio.
        <ul>
          <li>Family Radio Service (frs) - If you've ever used one of those small walkie-talkie-like devices that you can pick up at Wal Mart or other similar stores, it was mosts likely an frs radio.  These radios are inexpensive, small, lightweight, and have a very limited range (a mile or so if you're lucky.)  frs radio trnsmissions are limited to 2 watts.  No license is required to use this type of radio.
          </li>
          <li>Citizen's Band (CB) - Citizen's Band Radio had its heyday in the 1970's.  It was a very popular way for travelers, expecially truck drivers, to communicate with each other while on the road. (10-4 Good Buddy!) Rather than dealing with tuning in frequencies, the radio spectrum used by CB radio is broken up in to 40 "channels".  Each channel is a frequency, but the radio operator does not have to worry about what the frequency is for which channel is.  CB Radios are usually mobile devices (meaning they go in your car) but there are handheld walkie-talking versions as well as home base stations.  CB radio transmissions are limited to 4 watts.  No license is required to use cb radios. 
          </li>
          <li>General Mode Radio Service (gmrs) - gmrs radios are more powerful that the other two types already discussed.  Their range is farther, and this radio service introduces the concept of a repeater.  A repeater literally listens for a signal, and repeats it in real time, effectively extending the reach of the radio signal. gmrs radio transmissions are limited to 50 watts.  A license is required to operate a gmrs radio, but there is no exam needed - only a fee of $35, which covers everyone in your family.  The license needs to be renewed (and the fee paid) every 10 years. 
          </li>
          <li>Amateur (ham) radio - Ham radio allows one to communicate directly between radios as well as by using repeaters.  In addition to talking over the radio, ham radio offers digital modes so you can have your computer talk to other computers all over the world without the assistance of the Internet.  There are also digital modes that allow you to use your radio (or computer or cellphone) to send signals over the internet to distant radios and transmit over the air from that distant radio.  For example, one can transmit from Altoona, PA, have the signal go over the internet, and then that signal can be retransmitted from a repeater in Europe (or anywheree in the world) so ham operators near that repeater can hear and respond to the original signal.  Ham radio transmissions are limited based on the operator's license type - from 200 watts for a technician license up to 1500 watts for general and extra license holders. The range of a transmission is limited by type of transmission, power being used, antenna type, and atmospheric conditions.  A license is required to operate amateur (ham) radio.  There are three levels of license currently offered: technician, general, and extra, in ascending order of privliges.  Each license type requires passing a knowledge test.  There is a fee of $35 for the license, which needs to be renewed every 10 years.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>What Kinds of Things Can I do with Amateur Radio?</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Public Service</li>
          <li>Emergency Service (ARES)</li>
          <li>Stay in contact with family and friends in the event of a cell/phone outage</li>
          <li>Rag-Chewing (having long conversations)</li>
          <li>Making contact with other hams in the neighborhood or anywhere in the world</li>
          <li>Contesting - making as many quick contacts as you can over a given period of time (usually a day or a weekend)</li>
          <li>Digital (computer to computer communication with no Internet)</li>
          <li>Digital (voice transmitted over the air and via Internet)</li>
          <li>Using satellite repeaters including the international space station</li>
          <li>Moon bounce (EME) - literally bouncing a signal off the moon</li>
          <li>Learning about and building your own antennas</li>
          <li>Learning about electronics - Building your own radio</li>
          <li>Learning radio wave propogations - how radio signals are reflected, refracted, or blocked by Earth's atmosphere</li>
        </ul>

      </p>
      <h3>How Many Ham License Levels Are There?</h3>
      <p>There are currently three levels of amateur radio license offered in the United States, and there are no age restrictions:
        <ol>
          <li>Techician - The "beginner" level.  It grants privileges to use uhf and vhf radios (most handheld or mobile radios) and some privileges for hf frequencies.  Most local repeaters are on vhf or uhf frequencies, and this is the level of license needed to use EchoLink and other digital voice over-the-internet modes.  Many people get this level of license and can do everything they want so never go on to higher levels.</li>
          <li>General - gives privileges to most of the hf (high frequency) band frequencies.  These are the frequencies most used for long-distance communication.  You must pass the Technican license exam before taking the general exam.</li>
          <li>Amateur Extra - The highest level, and gives full privileges to all ham bands.  You must pass the general exam before taking the extra exam.</li>
        </ol>
        When you're ready, the HARC offers in-person <a href="./exams.html">exam sessions</a> for all license levels.
